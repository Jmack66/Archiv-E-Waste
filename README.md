# Archiv-E-Waste

<h2> Motivation:</h2>
E-Waste recycling is becoming an increasingly mainstream topic, and perhaps finds even more relevance due to the on-going global chip shortage.Throughout the course of researching the topic, it became clear there exists a wide variety of e-waste projects, but a significant lack in the centralization of useful information. The goal of this project is to create a platform that encourages collaboration into the development of useful e-waste components. Ideally, a collection of  components (servo designs, actuators, sensors, controllers) is created, providing information such as where to find the electronic and mechanical components, and how to assemble the end product. The cornerstone is ensuring the accessibility of components and materials. This democratization of robotics allows for a wider reach of research and development in the field.
